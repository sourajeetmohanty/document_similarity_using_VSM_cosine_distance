# document_similarity_using_VSM_cosine_distance

**About the project:**
This project is about measuring similarity between two documents.A sort of plagiarism checker is what it is all about.Plagiarism as we all know is a sheer malpractice of copying contents of a file from another file.The ideas and hardwork goes all in vain. 

Here we measure the similarity by using a process of algorithms and operations.We are going to discuss all those processes one by one and also provide associated codes along with them.
