# document_similarity_using_VSM_cosine_distance

**About the project:**
This project is about measuring similarity between two documents.A sort of plagiarism checker is what it is all about.Plagiarism as we all know is a sheer malpractice of copying contents of a file from another file.The ideas and hardwork goes all in vain. 

Here we measure the similarity by using a process of algorithms and operations.We are going to discuss all those processes one by one and also provide associated codes along with them.

**The process to follow:**
For obtaining similarity between two documents we have to graduate a scale and measure factors between the two. For that We will use VSM(VECTOR SPACE MODEL). 

**VSM(VECTOR SPACE MODEL)**
In this we represent the documents as vectors, then apply a distance formula on them, hence giving the similarity. The operation that we use on them is *Cosine similarity*.The documents are imagined as two vectors in the free dimensional space.Cosine similarity is not the only way to operate this but in this project I will be using the same.
